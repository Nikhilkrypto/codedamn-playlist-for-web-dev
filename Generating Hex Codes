why we're using padstart =due to from 0-15 the number is a single digit number and dur to that it will result into less than 6 digit number and now we have to put 0 in the prefix for that so we're doing taht
to method 
i> padstart used to store some result at the prefix of a string until the total length upto a given sequence 
syntax=string.padstart(length of numbers which we want to put ,'string in place of that');
